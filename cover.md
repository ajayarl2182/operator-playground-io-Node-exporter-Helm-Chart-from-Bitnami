**What is Node Exporter ?**

The node exporter can read system-level statistics about bare-metal nodes or virtual machines and export them for Prometheus. Using a DaemonSet, Kubernetes can run one node exporter per cluster node, and expose the node exporter as a service.

Node Exporter is a Prometheus exporter for server level and OS level metrics with configurable metric collectors. It helps us in measuring various server resources such as RAM, disk space, and CPU utilization
